reversi
=======

A DOS game that I have written with Turbo Pascal 20 years ago. It uses AI algorithms (minimax with alpha and beta pruning). The name of the game LP stends for *Loja me Pulla* (*Game of Spots* in English). Later I learned that in English it is actually called *Reversi*.

It can run on Linux with `dosbox`:
```
sudo apt-get install dosbox
dosbox LP.EXE
```

To compile it maybe you can use Free Pascal:
```
sudo apt-get install fp-compiler fp-ide
```

However I haven't tried it myself (LP.EXE is almost 20 years old).
